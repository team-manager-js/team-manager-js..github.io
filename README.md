# Team Manager Project

## The project is deployed on GitHub Pages , Back4App is used for backend service - https://team-manager-js.github.io/

Small project using JS, HTML and CSS. Page library is used for routing and Lit-Html for templating.
Higher complexity compared to my other similar project.

The app supports functionality for 5 different user types:
- Admin - create, edit, kick members or accept/decline invitations.
- member - see other members and leave team.
- pending - see members and withdraw request to join.
- not involved - logged in user who can request membership
- guest - not logged in user with limited access.

The details view has the most complexity.
