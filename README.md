# Team Manager Project

Small project using JS, HTML, CSS and Back4App for backend service. Page library is used for routing and lit-html for templating.
Higher complexity compared to my other similar project.

The app supports functionality for 5 different user types:
- Admin - create, edit, kick members or accept/decline invitations.
- member - see other members and leave team.
- pending - see members and withdraw request to join.
- not involved - logged in user who can request membership
- guest - not logged in user with limited access.

The details view has the most complexity.
