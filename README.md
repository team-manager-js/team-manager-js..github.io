# Team Manager Project

Small project using JS, HTML, CSS and Back4App for backend service. Page library is used for routing and lit-html for templating.
Higher complexity compared to my other similar project.

The details page has the most complexity, It supports 5 different views depending what kind of user is viewing. The rest is a standart catalog app.
